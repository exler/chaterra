</p>

## Overview

Chaterra is a web-based frontend for OpenAI's GPT and DALL-E models. It is designed to be a simple and easy-to-use user interface that allows you to take advantage of the usage-based pricing model of OpenAI's API.

Chaterra stores all data in the browser and since [OpenAI does not use their API platform to train their models](https://help.openai.com/en/articles/5722486-how-your-data-is-used-to-improve-model-performance), it can be used as a privacy-friendly alternative to the official ChatGPT frontend.
